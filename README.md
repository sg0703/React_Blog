# React_Blog
React Blog is a very basic blog app that uses React, React Router, Redux, and OAuth for the client side, and Node, Express, and MongoDB Atlas for the API. Users can login with their Google accounts and submit posts that will be displayed to the main page. I am creating this app to practice React/Redux!

Coming soon.
